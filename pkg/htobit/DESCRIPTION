Description: Heteroscedastic tobit regression models are provided.
  These are Gaussian regression models with a response variable left-censored at zero
  and both distribution parameters (the latent location and scale)
  can depend on covariates. An identity link is employed for the location
  equation and a log link for the scale equation.
